\section{Morfeas System Architecture}
The Morfeas system defined as the collection of programs which works as group to implement the scopes of the introduction.
The Morfeas System designed with the "Microsystem" architecture model. Multiple programs where are design to do one or more specific tasks
and communicating via via Inter Processing Communication (IPC) mechanism.
The tasks that the Morfeas system is responsible to do are the controlling of the remote devices, to extract, decode, and encode data from one protocol or other.
All that in an automated manner and also to run from the userspace without need of any extra privilege.

This design philosophy described by the name of the project ``Morfeas'' which is the Latinisation of the Greek word
\selectlanguage{greek}``Μορφέας''.\selectlanguage{english} where translate to: Him that can give or change form (or shape).
Exactly as every component does to the data that is handling.
