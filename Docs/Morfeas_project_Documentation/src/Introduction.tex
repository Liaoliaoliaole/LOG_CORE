\section{Introduction}
The Morfeas project was initially start as an implementation of a software gateway solution system
(currently named Morfeas-Proto) that provide (and translate) measurements data from some proprietary devices (SDAQ family)
with CANbus compatible interface (SDAQnet) to OPC-UA protocol (Open62541).

As the Morfeas project developed additional support added for other devices (MDAQ, IO-BOX, MTI) with different interfaces (ModBus-TCP).

Furthermore, a web interface sub-project added to the Morfeas project under the name "Morfeas-web".
Thisof, will provide a layman friendly configuration interface for the gateway, the OPC-UA server's Nodeset and the connected devices.
