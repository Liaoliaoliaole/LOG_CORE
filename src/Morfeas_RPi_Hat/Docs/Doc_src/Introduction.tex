\section{Introduction}
This document referred as Documentation for the "Morfeas\_RPi\_Hat" device. This is a PCB shield that is designed to be compatible with the Raspberry Pi pin header.
The purpose of this device is to provide electrical measurements and an electronic fuse for each of the SDAQnet ports, also provide a real time clock and 
a RS-323 serial port with purpose to be the backport teletype of the Morfeas system unit. 
The measurements that supporter is Output voltage of the port, supplied port's current and temperature of each current sense amplifier (CSA) silicon die.\\
In addition an electronic fuse is implemented for each port that limit the supply current to $\approx$4A.
Also an EEPROM with the calibration data for each CSA is located on board. The communication between the onboard devices and the RPi done
via Inter-Integrated Circuit ($I^2C$) Bus.

The "Morfeas\_RPi\_Hat" is designed at KiCAD5 and distributed under the TAPRv1 or later. 
The supporting software for this device is written in ANSI C and distributed under GPLv3 or later. 
This document is distributed under FDLv1.3 or later.
